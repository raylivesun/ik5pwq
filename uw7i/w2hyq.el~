;; For example, one vacation, having a week or so to hack Lisp, I decided to try writing a
;; version of a program—a system for breeding genetic algorithms to play the game of Go—that
;; I had written early in my career as a Java programmer. Even handicapped by my then rudimen-
;; tary knowledge of Common Lisp and having to look up even basic functions, it still felt more
;; productive than it would have been to rewrite the same program in Java, even with several
;; extra years of Java experience acquired since writing the first version.

;; A similar experiment led to the library I’ll discuss in Chapter 24.
;; Early in my time at WebLogic I had written a library, in Java, for
;; taking apart Java class files. It worked, but the code was a bit of
;; a mess and hard to modify or extend. I had tried several times, over
;; the years, to rewrite that library, thinking that with my ever-improving
;; Java chops I’d find some way to do it that didn’t bog down in piles
;; of duplicated code. I never found a way. But when I tried to do it
;; in Common Lisp, it took me only two days, and I ended up not only
;; with a Java class file parser but with a general-purpose library
;; for taking apart any kind of binary file. You’ll see how that library
;; works in Chapter 24 and use it in Chapter 25 to write a parser for the
;; ID3 tags embedded in MP3 files.

;; Why Lisp?
;; It’s hard, in only a few pages of an introductory chapter, to explain
;; why users of a language like it, and it’s even harder to make the case
;; for why you should invest your time in learning a certain language.
;; Personal history only gets us so far. Perhaps I like Lisp because of
;; some quirk in the way my brain is wired. It could even be genetic,
;; since my dad has it too. So before you dive into learning Lisp, it’s
;; reasonable to want to know what the payoff is going to be.
